# 🎮 Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI using Minimax Algorithm

This is **Task 2** for the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
In this project, I built an unbeatable **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** using the **Minimax algorithm**.

## 📌 Project Description

The game is designed for a **human vs AI** setup. The AI evaluates all possible moves using the minimax algorithm and chooses the best one to ensure it either **wins or forces a draw** — making it impossible to beat.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab (for execution and testing)
- Console-based interaction

## ✨ Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI that cannot be defeated (uses recursion & optimal strategy)
- Detects win, loss, and tie conditions
- Clean, easy-to-understand code structure

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Copy and paste the `tictactoe_ai.py` code into a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run it in any Python environment.
2. Run the script.
3. Enter your moves (1–9) when prompted.



## ✅ Status
✔️ Project Completed  
✔️ Tested on Google Colab  
✔️ Open for future improvements (GUI, difficulty levels, multiplayer)
